# To start MySQL automatically at boot, be sure this script is executable:
# chmod 755 /etc/rc.d/rc.mysqld

# Before you can run MySQL, you must have a database.  To install an initial
# database, do this as root:
#
#   mysql_install_db --user=mysql
#
# Note that the mysql user must exist in /etc/passwd, and the created files
# will be owned by this dedicated user.  This is important, or else mysql
# (which runs as user "mysql") will not be able to write to the database
# later (this can be fixed with 'chown -R mysql.mysql /var/lib/mysql').
#
# To increase system security, consider using "mysql_secure_installation"
# as well.  For more information on this tool, please read:
#   man mysql_secure_installation

# To allow outside connections to the database comment out the next line.
# If you don't need incoming network connections, then leave the line
# uncommented to improve system security.
